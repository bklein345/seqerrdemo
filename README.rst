Overview
========

This package provides a demonstration of my knowledge of Python, pysam,
and next-generation sequencing.
Specifically, this package comprises a simple program for finding
sequencing errors in paired-end next-generation sequencing data,
e.g. Illumina data.
Sequencing errors are sites where two paired-end reads sequence the same
position of DNA but disagree on the called base.


Usage
-----

Install the package and then use the command `FindSequencingErrors`.
